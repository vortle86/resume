<div id="whatName" class="faqtext">
  <p>My name is Elisheba, pronounced ellie-sheva.  The b sounds like a v, and it helps many people to imagine pronouncing two words. </p> 
  <h4>I'll never get that!</h4>
  <p>Sure you will.  Here's what it sounds like, so now you can practice 100 times each night before you go to bed!</p>

<p>Elisheba is <a class='tooltips'>Hebrew<span>אלישבע</span></a>, an earlier form of the name that later became Elizabeth.  It's rare here, but in Israel and in some American Orthodox Jewish communities, it's a very common name.</p>

<div id="where" class="faqtext">
<p>I'm a Colorado Native and grew up in Denver.  I received my BA from <a href="http://www.sjc.edu/">St John's College</a> in Santa Fe and have spent most of my career working in human services (supporting at-risk youth and people with disabilities) and education (as a special education teacher from kinder to postsecondary.)  I've traveled throughout Latin America and visited Israel, but I keep ending up back home to Colorado.</p>

<!--faq/Why code-->
<button type="button" id="whyCode" class="belize-hole-flat-button" onclick="infotext(this)">Why coding?</button><br />

<div id="why" class="faqtext">
<p>My experience, while technology rich, has not been primarily tech-focused.  Both my father and brother are developers, and as a result I grew up with lots of exposure to and experiences with computers and software including some beginning programming experience.  I learned to be curious and to try to solve my own problems, as well as to use available resources (human and other) to figure things out.  As a result of this active outlook toward technology and software, I have been able to develop a broader-than-average skill set with basic office and personal applications which has made me a valuable troubleshooting resource among my colleagues throughout my career.</p>
<p>I also have extensive experience in studying languages (Spanish, French, Ancient Greek, and Hebrew), and while I understand the serious distinctions between programming languages and communication languages, I find that intimate understanding with the structure and function of linguistic elements and an ability to combine, parse, and translate between those elements is supportive when working with code.</p>
<p>Possibly my most robust skillset when considering studying software development is my mathematical knowledge.  I have studied and taught advanced mathematics throughout my educational and professional career including graduate work in mathematics education.  I thrive on finding patterns, solving problems, and working within structure.</p>
<p>I'm excited to begin my new career as a developer in a setting which allows me use my energy and experience while developing my technical skills and serving as part of a team.</p>

<!--faq/hobbies-->
<button type="button" id="whatElse" class="belize-hole-flat-button" onclick="infotext(this)">What else floats your boat?</button><br />
<div id="boat" class="faqtext">
<p>Somehow, even when I'm not practicing and studying to become a <a class='tooltips'>Level 49 CodeWizard<div><img src="http://elishebafay.com/PracticeStuff/Pictures/e-hat.jpg" height="100"><br />I hear you get a better hat at Level 49.</div></a>Level 49 CodeWizard, I manage to keep busy.  </p>
<p>I'm interested in xeriscape gardening and have been slowly working to landscape my property in ways that are respectful of our state's limited water resources and ecological balance.</p>
<p>I'm also a former professional dog trainer. These days I only train my own dogs, but we have plenty to work on! My current dogs, Inspector SpaceTime (Spector for short) and Katniss, are both young and inexperienced, but I hope to compete with them in dog sports including obedience, rally obedience, and agility.  We also play with herding, nosework, and lurecoursing just for fun.</p>
<p>In order to maintain my license as a Coloradan, I'm contractually obligated to mention that I love to get outdoors, hike, camp, and explore in our beautiful state! (Fortunately enough, it's also true!)</p>
