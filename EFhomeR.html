<div id="whatName" class="faqtext">
  <p>My name is Elisheba, pronounced ellie-sheva.  The b sounds like a v, and it helps many people to imagine pronouncing two words. </p> 
  <h4>I'll never get that!</h4>
  <p>Sure you will.  Here's what it sounds like, so now you can practice 100 times each night before you go to bed!</p>

<p>Elisheba is <a class='tooltips'>Hebrew<span>אלישבע</span></a>, an earlier form of the name that later became Elizabeth.  It's rare here, but in Israel and in some American Orthodox Jewish communities, it's a very common name.</p>

<p>I'm a Colorado Native and grew up in Denver.  I received my BA from <a href="http://www.sjc.edu/">St John's College</a> in Santa Fe and have spent most of my career working in human services (supporting at-risk youth and people with disabilities) and education (as a special education teacher from kinder to postsecondary.)  I've traveled throughout Latin America and visited Israel, but I keep ending up back home in Colorado.</p>

<!--faq/Why code-->
<button type="button" id="whyCode" class="belize-hole-flat-button" onclick="infotext(this)">Why coding?</button><br />

<div id="why" class="faqtext">
<p>My experience, while technology rich, has not been primarily tech-focused.  Both my father and brother are developers, and as a result I grew up with lots of exposure to and experiences with computers and software including some beginning programming experience.  I learned to be curious and to try to solve my own problems, as well as to use available resources (human and other) to figure things out.  As a result of this active outlook toward technology and software, I have been able to develop a broader-than-average skill set with basic office and personal applications which has made me a valuable troubleshooting resource among my colleagues throughout my career.</p>
<p>I also have extensive experience in studying languages (Spanish, French, Ancient Greek, and Hebrew), and while I understand the serious distinctions between programming languages and communication languages, I find that intimate understanding with the structure and function of linguistic elements and an ability to combine, parse, and translate between those elements is supportive when working with code.</p>
<p>Possibly my most robust skillset when considering studying software development is my mathematical knowledge.  I have studied and taught advanced mathematics throughout my educational and professional career including graduate work in mathematics education.  I thrive on finding patterns, solving problems, and working within structure.</p>
<p>I'm excited to begin my new career as a developer in a setting which allows me use my energy and experience while developing my technical skills and serving as part of a team.</p>

<div id="boat" class="faqtext">
<p>Somehow, even when I'm not practicing and studying to become a Level 49 CodeWizard, I manage to keep busy.  </p>
<div id="level49"><img src="http://elishebafay.com/PracticeStuff/Pictures/e-hat.jpg" alt="GrumpyHat" id="GrumpyHat"><br />I hear you get a better hat at Level 49.</div>
<p>I'm interested in xeriscape gardening and have been slowly working to landscape my property in ways that are respectful of our state's limited water resources and ecological balance.</p>
<p>I'm also a former professional dog trainer. These days I only train my own dogs, but we have plenty to work on! My current dogs, Inspector SpaceTime (Spector for short) and Katniss, are both young and inexperienced, but I hope to compete with them in dog sports including obedience, rally obedience, and agility.  We also play with herding, nosework, and lurecoursing just for fun.</p>
<p>In order to maintain my license as a Coloradan, I'm legally obligated to mention that I love to get outdoors, hike, camp, and explore in our beautiful state! (Fortunately enough, it's also true!)</p>

<p>The undergraduate liberal arts program is routinely selected as one of the most rigorous college experiences in the US because of its intense Great Books curriculum and seminar-based teaching style.  Curriculum consists  of discussion of primary source works  from the Western canon of philosophical, religious, historical, mathematical, scientific, and literary works and is considered to be equivalent to a double major in mathematics and philosophy with a triple minor in ancient language, classic literature, and music.  The discussion based learning environment fosters deep and effective communication skills for listening, effective questioning, and collaboration.</p>
